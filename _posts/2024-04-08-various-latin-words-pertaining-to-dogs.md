most european languages settled on one or two common words for 'dog' pretty early on, but latin had a few, and i wanna talk about them :D 

the primary word for any general dog in latin comes from the same Proto-Indo-European root as 'hound' in english, and 'hund' in norwegian and german. the root in PIE was  \*ḱwṓ, \*ḱun-, and became *canēs* then later *canis* in latin. canis becomes *chien* in french and the formal spanish *can*. but *canis* is just the general word for any dog, but most often would describe a medium-large adult dog, like this :DDD ![adult german shepherd dog laying on a brown tile floor looking inquisitively at the camera](https://github.com/scarletbees/scarletbees.github.io/assets/132917722/0908078f-5e56-45c3-abc6-e6696f0ce624)
   
but there are plenty sillier words ^-^  

we'll start w *catulus, catellus, canīculus* and *canīcula*. these are all words that would be used to describe this dog: ![german shepherd puppy laying sideways on a grey couch with a pink collar on. attached to a lead. her name is riya and i love her](https://github.com/scarletbees/scarletbees.github.io/assets/132917722/b4376b0b-f5a3-4e8d-b9ca-0538894b99cd)


from proto-italic *\*katelos* "cub" comes *catulus*, and from that follows *catellus*. these were both words for any animals' cub even as late as the 200's ad in the case of *catulus*, but had primary definitions of a dog's cub. neither word was employed by the entire population, and it seems *catulus* may have been favored in comparison to *catellus*, seeing as the former is attested both far earlier and far more than the latter. in a similar vein, *canīculus, -a* is the primary word for dog, *canis*, with an attached diminutive suffix. the diminutive in any language just serves to make the noun smaller or cuter, and oftentimes more feminine in the case of european languages specifically. both the masculine and feminine form of *canīculus* can and have been used as terms for a puppy, but in post-calssical attestations they are more often used as insults. a *canīculus* is any person who is persistent and annoying in the same way a puppy would be, one who nags. *canīcula* was used slightly more sparingly as an insult, and usually served to put down a woman who was loud, or made her own decisions. crazy, i know, women doing things ^-^ but it was most often used as the word for *Canis Minor*, or the lesser dogstar, which is incredibly based in my opinion.  

then theres **molossus**, which is probably my least favorite dog related word in latin. and its ugly so it doesnt deserve italics. it just means a stocky, large dog. so now we get to my favorite !!!  

the word *lātrātor* is probably my favorite word ever. not only is it phonetically pleasing, but its also really funny. *lātrātor* comes from the verb *lātrō, lātrāvi* and it means barker :DDDDD isnt that adorable.  

anyway thats all i really have to say and my sources were the lewis and short dictionary of latin, DMLBS, and the university of chicago latin text corpus, all of which can be accessed thru the university of chicago's site [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82)
